# Cyclistic-Bike-Share-Case-Study
## Project Objective
Data analysis project exploring member vs casual rider behavior using R and public Divvy data
## 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes how **annual members** and **casual riders** use Cyclistic’s bike-share program differently.  
It follows the **Google Data Analytics Capstone structure**: Ask → Prepare → Process → Analyze → Share → Act.

## 🎯 Business Task
Identify how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently to design marketing strategies that convert casual riders into annual members.

## 🧩 Tools Used
- R, RStudio  
- tidyverse, lubridate, ggplot2, flexdashboard  
- Google Slides for presentation

## 🧹 Process Summary
1. Combined 12 months of Divvy trip data (Nov 2023 – Oct 2024)  
2. Cleaned and filtered invalid rides (duration <1 min or >24 hr)  
3. Created new fields: `ride_length`, `day_of_week`, `month`, `hour`  
4. Performed descriptive analysis and visualization  

## 📈 Key Insights
- Casual riders take **longer rides**, mostly on **weekends**  
- Members take **shorter rides**, mostly during **weekday commute hours**  
- Both ride groups peak in **summer months**

## 🚀 Recommendations
1. Offer **weekend or seasonal membership promotions**  
2. **Target casual riders** with personalized digital campaigns  
3. Emphasize **cost savings and convenience** for frequent leisure riders
